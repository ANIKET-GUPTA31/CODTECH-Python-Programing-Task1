# CODTECH-Python-Programing-Task1

## Overview

This project implements a simple calculator using Python's `turtle` graphics library. The calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The results are displayed using the turtle graphics interface.

## Features

- Input two numbers via dialog boxes.
- Choose an arithmetic operation (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division).
- Display the result on the turtle graphics screen.
- Handle division by zero gracefully with an error message.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your system. The `turtle` module is included with the standard Python library, so no additional installation is required.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/simple-calculator.git
   cd simple-calculator
   ```

2. **Run the Program**:
   ```sh
   python calculator.py
   ```

3. **Follow the Prompts**:
   - Enter two numbers when prompted.
   - Select the operation you wish to perform by entering the corresponding number or symbol.
   - The result will be displayed on the turtle graphics window.

## Code Explanation

- `calculate()`: Function to perform the calculation based on user input and display the result using turtle graphics.
- `turtle.setup()`: Configures the turtle graphics window.
- `turtle.numinput()`: Prompts the user to enter numbers.
- `turtle.textinput()`: Prompts the user to choose an operation.
- `turtle.write()`: Displays the result on the screen.
